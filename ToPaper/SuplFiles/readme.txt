SupplementaryTable1.csv

Mutationsal spectra for vertebrates species (967 species from 5 classes).

Species - Name of vertebrate species in latin for which the 192-component mitochondrial mutation spectrum was calculated
Class - Class of vertebrate animal out of five possible: actinopterygii, amphibia, lepidosauria, mammalia, aves
Next columns present the unique substitutions with the normalized substitution rate for them
All the values of the substitution rates are rounded to 3 decimal places.


SupplementaryTable2.csv

Average 192-component mutational spectra of 5 vertebrate classes, vertebrates together, and human cancers in COSMIC format.

We provide a comprehensive overview of the normalized substitution rates for different types of substitutions 
in five classes of vertebrates, as well as the combined analysis for all vertebrates and human cancers. 
All the values of the substitution rates are rounded to 4 decimal places.
