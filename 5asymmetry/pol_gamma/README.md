Supplementary Fig. S15. Symmetrical mutagenesis of mtDNA shaped by POLG
Recalculation  of POLG’ mutational spectrum based on experimental data (Zheng et al. 2006). We demonstrate that normalized rates of CH>TH and GH>AH mutations are rather the same, confirming the symmetrical nature of mutations,  mediated by POLG via cytosine deamination.
